    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <input type="checkbox"> 
    <label for="">2 cups unsalted butter, room temperature</label>
    <input type="checkbox"> 
    <label for="">3 1/2 cups brown sugar, loosely packed</label>
    <input type="checkbox"> 
    <label for="">2 large eggs</label>
    <input type="checkbox"> 
    <label for="">2 teaspoons vanilla extract</label>

    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar until fluffy and light. Add eggs and vanilla, mixing gently until just combined.
    </li>
    <li>Add flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix until combined into a soft dough.</li>
    <li>Form into balls (about ¼ cup per cookie / ball). Roll each ball in the extra sugar (mixed with cardamom, if you want). Bake for 10-12 minutes (I recommend 6-8 at a time on the baking sheet, so you’ll need to bake in batches). Remove from oven and let them rest – you want the cookies settle down a bit and give you crisped edges with thicker, soft-baked centers.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>NOTES</h2>
    <p>These cookies are delicate and they can break easily, so be sure to let them cool fully before handling them too much. I’d recommend storing them in the fridge so they stay a bit stronger for transporting around to all your various Christmas events.</p>
    <p>If you find the dough is very sticky, or if you aren’t getting the slightly puffed centers like you see in the photos, try adding a tablespoon more flour to the remaining dough.</p>
